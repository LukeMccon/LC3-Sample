LC3-Sample Code

A segment of LC-3 16 bit assembly used in a project. The code was randomly sampled and was part of a proprietary decryption algorithm that I implemented. This project helped to demonstrate understanding of memory within the LC3 and storage using pointers. All assembly was assembled using the free PennSim simulator for LC-3. I am only able to post a small fragment due to policies.
