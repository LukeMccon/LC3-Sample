LC3-Sample Code

A few segments of LC-3 16 bit assembly used in a project. The code was randomly sampled and was part of a proprietary decryption algorithm that was implemented. This project helped to demonstrate understanding of memory within the LC3 and storage using pointers. All assembly was assembled using the free PennSim simulator for LC-3.
